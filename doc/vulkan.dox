@brief State of Vulkan support, version and extension requirements.

The following table maps Vulkan function names to Magnum API, useful for
developers with existing Vulkan background. Note that, as reverse mapping, each
function documentation also contains list of Vulkan functions used. You can
also use the search functionality to find out which Vulkan API corresponds to
which Magnum function, class or enum value. Just enter name of an Vulkan
function, define or GLSL name into the search box.
